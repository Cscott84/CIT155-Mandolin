			<h2>A Type Mandolin</h2>
			<img src="images/A_type.jpeg" alt="a type Mandolin">
			<p>The A style mandolin has a pear- or tear-shaped body, or A-shape, which is where it gets its name, of course. 
			This instrument is very streamlined and simple in design, which puts it at a lower price point than F style mandolins, for example.<br><br>
			
			Due to its simple design and lower cost, the A style tends to be better for beginner players. This shape has been around since the mandolin was invented, 
			but the instrument used to be made with a bowl back.This rounded back lent to an interesting sound but created some difficulty for the player holding and using it. In the early 1900s, 
			during a great peak in mandolin popularity after the Paris World Fair of 1892, Gibson redesigned the instrument.</p>

				<h2>F Type Mandolin</h2>
				<img src="images/F_type.jpg" alt="F type Mandolin">
				<p>F style mandolins get their name from Florentine style.F style mandolins are favoured by bluegrass, roots and professional players. 
				They feature fancier design work including a scroll and point, and are at a higher price point.They may not be ideal for the beginner player on a budget, 
				but they are beautiful instruments that add a great deal of flare to the playing experience.<br><br>

				The F style mandolin was designed by Gibson in the early 1900s as a top of the line instrument, incorporating traditional 
				mandolin design and sound while giving it a flat back and scrollwork on the body.These extra design elements to the F style put it at a higher price point that the simpler A styles.
				These mandolins have, in addition to their lavish embellishments, two f-holes like a violin or a single oval hole. The extra curlycues in the body increase the body volume, which contributes to the overall sound.
				This extra element also makes it easier to place the instrument on oneâ€™s thigh, so when the player is seated and playing, the instrument stays in place without much effort.</p>

			<h2>Bowl Neck / Neopalitan</h2>
			<img src="images/bowlback.jpg" alt="bowl Back mandolin">
			<p>The bowl-back is exactly as it sounds: a fretted string instrument with a very round back that sits against the player like a bowl. 
			It is the style of mandolin often depicted in film or television as a stereotype of the instrument.<br><br>
			
			It is also known as a taterbug or watermelon. This is a very old-fashioned style of mandolin that resembles early Italian lutes, 
			the instrument from which the modern day mandolin evolved.The deep bowl makes for deeper tones than the flatback styles, but they are rare to find. 
			Often they are antique lute-violin hybrids and run a high cost.They are less practical for playing purposes, but have undeniable strong tonal resonance.</p>
