			<h2>The Hobby</h2>
			<img src="images/me.jpg" alt="my hobby">
			<p>Hello, My name is Corey Scott, I consider myself a music enthusiast, I've enjoyed playing music since from about the age of ten. 
			When i was in the navy, I decided i wanted to learn how to play the mandolin, and it never quite took off the way I had hoped.However, 
			many years later, with the help and motivation from my wife, I decided it was time to get serious about the mandolin and I started taking lessons
			from a very talented musician and teacher named Jesse Pena. I enjoy playing and learning the mandolin very much, and hopefully this site will help inform
			 and educate about an instrument I find amazingly unique.<br><br>
			 
			 My favorite mandolin players and influencers are :<a href="legends.html#dave"> David Grisman</a>, <a href="legends.html#Sam">Sam Bush</a>, <a href="legends.html#Bill"> Bill Monroe</a>, Ricky Scaggs, and Chris Thile.

				<h2>The Way of Life</h2>

				<p>Some people consider music as a way to escape from the pain of life. It gives you relief and allows you to reduce the stress. 
				Music is a powerful therapy that will make you calm down and in the moment of joy, it will make you cheerful.Furthermore, 
				it develops the mind and boosts your self confidence. Music plays a more important role in our life than just being a source of entertainment.</p>

			thought... The mandolin brings much joy and excitment to my life.
