			<h2>BlueGrass</h2>
			<img src="images/newsouth.jpg" alt="blugrass">
			
			 <p>BlueGrass music is a genre of American roots music that developed in the 1940s in the United States Appalachian region.
			 Bluegrass has roots in traditional English, Scottish and Irish ballads and dance tunes, and in traditional African-American blues and jazz.
			 Bluegrass features acoustic string instruments and emphasizes the off-beat. Notes are anticipated, in contrast to laid back blues where notes are 
			 behind the beat, which creates the higher energy characteristic of bluegrass.[1] In bluegrass, as in some forms of jazz, 
			 one or more instruments each takes its turn playing the melody and improvising around it, while the others perform accompaniment; 
			 this is especially typified in tunes called breakdowns.<br><br>
			 
			 Unlike mainstream country music, bluegrass is traditionally played on acoustic stringed instruments. 
			 The fiddle, five-string banjo, guitar, mandolin, and upright bass (string bass) are often joined by the resonator guitar 
			 (also referred to as a Dobro) and (occasionally) harmonica or Jew's harp. This instrumentation originated in rural dance bands and is the basis on which the 
			 earliest bluegrass bands were formed.

				<h2>Traditional Irish</h2>
				<img src="images/irish.jpg" alt="traditional irish">
				<p>Traditional Irish music is a genre of folk music that was developed in Ireland.
				Though solo performance is preferred in the folk tradition, bands or at least small ensembles have probably been a part of 
				Irish music since at least the mid-19th century, although this is a point of much contention among ethnomusicologists.
				Historically much old-time music of the USA grew out of the music of Ireland, England and Scotland, as a result of cultural diffusion. 
				By the 1970s Irish traditional music was again influencing music in the US and further afield in Australia and Europe. 
				It has occasionally been fused with rock and roll, punk rock and other genres.<br><br>
				
				The mandolin has become a common instrument amongst Irish traditional musicians. Fiddle tunes are readily accessible to 
				the mandolin player because of the equivalent range of the two instruments and the practically identical (allowing for the lack of frets on the fiddle) left hand fingerings.
				Although almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for Irish traditional music, virtually all Irish players prefer flat-backed instruments with oval sound holes to the 
				Italian-style bowl-back mandolins or the carved-top mandolins with f-holes favoured by bluegrass mandolinists.

			<h2>Jazz</h2>
			<img src="images/jazz.jpeg" alt="Jazz mandolin">
			<p>Jazz is predominantly urban and often deals with relatively complex structures, chords and key changes. Bluegrass is predominantly rural and, like blues, often works within fairly predictable structural boundaries. But jazz and bluegrass are more alike than they appear. Both jazz and bluegrass place a high premium on instrumental virtuosity, 
			both feature sophisticated interplay between instruments and both rely heavily on improvisation, often at lightning speed.</p>
