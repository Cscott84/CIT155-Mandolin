			<h2>The Early Days</h2>
			<img src="images/history.jpg" alt="old times">
			<p>The mandolin is a modern member of the lute family, dating back to Italy in the 18th century. The instrument was played across Europe but then disappeared 
			after the Napoleonic Wars. Credit for creating the modern bowlback version of the instrument goes to the Vinaccia family of Naples. The deep bowled mandolin, 
			especially the Neapolitan form, became common in the 19th century, following the appearance of an international hit, the Spanish Students. They toured Europe and 
			America, and their performances created a stir that helped the mandolin to become widely popular.</p>

				<h2>The Golden Age</h2>
				<img src="images/goldenage.jpg" alt="golden Age">
				<p>The newfound awareness of the instrument created by the day's hit sensation, a wave of Italian mandolinists travelled Europe in the 
				1880s and 1890s and in the United States by the mid-1880s, playing and teaching their instrument.
				The instrument's popularity continued to increase during the 1890s and mandolin popularity was at its height in the "early years of the 20th century.</p>

			<h2>Modern Era</h2>
			<img src="images/christ2.jpg" alt="Chris Tile">
			<p>When the word "mandolin" is said in the 21st century, it usually refers to an instrument with 8 strings tuned in fifths, 
			such as the Neapolitan mandolin or the American bluegrass mandolin. It is also commonly thought that mandolino is diminutive of mandola, 
			and that therefore the mandolino was a smaller development of the mandola. The path from mandola to our modern mandolin was not so simple; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, 
			there were varieties of mandolin with different characteristics. As historians sorted instruments and traditions, 
			it became understood that our current mandolin may not be a true descendant of the mandola, or else it may be a blending of instrument-making traditions.
