			<img src="images/daveg.jpg" alt="David Grisman">
			<p>David Grisman is one of the most well known and influential mandolin players of all time. His music combines bluegrass, folk, and jazz in a genre he calls "Dawg music".
			He played in the bluegrass band the Kentuckians led by Red Allen, then in the psychedelic rock band Earth Opera with Peter Rowan. He moved to San Francisco, met Jerry Garcia 
			and appeared on the Grateful Dead album American Beauty.He played in Garcia's bluegrass band Old & In the Way with Peter Rowan and Vassar Clements.<br><br>
			
			Garcia named him "Dawg" after a dog that was following him while they were driving in Stinson Beach, 
			California. "Dawg Music" is what Grisman calls his mixture of bluegrass and Django Reinhardt/St√©phane Grappelli-influenced jazz as highlighted on his album Hot Dawg 
			(recorded Oct. 1978, released 1979). It was Grisman's combination of Reinhardt-era jazz, bluegrass, folk, Old World Mediterranean string band music, 
			as well as modern jazz fusion that came to embody "Dawg" music.

				<p> Bill Monroe was American mandolinist, singer, and songwriter, who created the style of music known as bluegrass. Because of this, he is often called the "Father of Bluegrass".
				The genre takes its name from his band, the Blue Grass Boys, who named their group for the Kentucky bluegrass of Monroe's home state of Kentucky. Monroe's performing career spanned 69 years as a singer, 
				instrumentalist, composer and bandleader.Key developments occurred in Monroe's music with the addition of Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs to the Blue Grass Boys in December 1945. Flatt played a solid rhythm guitar style that would help to set the course 
				for bluegrass timing. Scruggs played the banjo with a distinctive three-finger picking style that immediately caused a sensation among Opry audiences.<br><br>
				
				Bill was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1970, the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as an "early influence") in 1997.
				Jimmie Rodgers, Bob Wills, Hank Williams Sr., and Johnny Cash are the only other performers honored in all three. As the "father of bluegrass", he was also an inaugural inductee into the 
				International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in 1991. Monroe was a recipient of a 1982 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's 
				highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.

			<p>Sam Bush is an American mandolinist who is considered an originator of progressive bluegrass music.Born in Bowling Green, Kentucky, Bush was exposed to country and bluegrass music at an early age 
			through his father Charlie's record collection, and later by the Flatt & Scruggs television show. Buying his first mandolin at the age of 11, 
			his musical interest was further piqued when he attended the inaugural Roanoke, VA Bluegrass Festival in 1965. As a teen Bush took first place three 
			times in the junior division of the National Oldtime Fiddler's Contest in Weiser, ID. <br><br>
			As well as being an accomplished bluegrass vocalist, Bush also is an accomplished instrumentalist on mandolin and fiddle winning title of National Fiddle champion at fifteen years of age. 
			He was a founding member of the New Grass Revival and has been called a modern day Bill Monroe.
			Sam, affectionately "Sammy", or "Mr. Entertainment", also recalls meeting Mr. Monroe as a young teen. After demonstrating his mandolin technique Monroe offered the advice: "stick to the fiddle".
